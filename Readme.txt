Bookie.rb is a game that allows the user to place bets on the outcome of different sports games. The basketball hoop file is neseccary to download if you wish to display the basketball hoop ASCII art in the terminal, however you can simply comment it out if you dont want to display it.

In the future, I would like to add a person class, and give him attributes such as name, and money. So that we can keep track of the user, and actually set it so that if he looses a bet, it will deduct from his amount of money (and add if he wins a bet).
