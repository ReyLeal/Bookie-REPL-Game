Bookie.rb is a game that allows the user to place bets on the outcome of different sports games. The basketball hoop file is neseccary to download if you wish to display the basketball hoop ASCII art in the terminal, however you can simply comment it out if you dont want to display it.

In the future, I would like to add a person class, and give them attributes such as name, and money. So that we can keep track of the user, and actually set it so that if the user looses a bet, it will deduct from their amount of money (and add if the user wins a bet).
